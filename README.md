# Local Project Board
A simple, single-page Trello-like project management tool built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and plain JavaScript. This application allows you to organize projects and tasks on a Kanban-style board.

Features
Project Management: Create and switch between multiple project boards.

Task Organization: Add tasks with titles and descriptions.

Status Tracking: Move tasks between three columns: "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done."

Task Comments: Add comments to individual tasks to provide more detail or communicate with others (if they are using the same browser).

Local Storage: All project and task data is saved directly in your browser's local storage, so your work persists when you close the tab.

Important Note on Collaboration
This version of the project board does not support real-time collaboration between multiple users. Because it uses browser localStorage, all data is stored locally on your device and cannot be shared with other people. It is designed for personal use.

How to Use
Open the index.html file in any modern web browser.

Click the "+ New Project" button in the top right to create your first project.

Select the project from the buttons in the header.

Click "+ Add Task" to create a new task card.

Drag and drop or use the buttons on a task card to move it between the "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done" columns.

Click the "Comments" button on a task to view or add notes.

Technologies Used
HTML: For the application structure.

Tailwind CSS: For all styling and a responsive design.

JavaScript: For all application logic, including data management with localStorage.
